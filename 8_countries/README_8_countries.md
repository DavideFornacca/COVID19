# Detail for 8 countries
In this folder, you will find a datasets of 8 countries at the second administrative level or ADM2 (referred as provinces in Italy, France, and Spain, counties in the US, prefectures of China, departments in France, LTLA/NHS in the UK, districts in Germany) and in some cases at the firts administrative level or ADM1 (regions in Italy, provinces in Iran).
The datasets include total accumulated COVID-19 data (infections, deaths, and mortality rates), COVID-19 data normalized by population size (100k residents), population size and densities, air pollution metrics from ground stations (China, Italy, and the US) and satellite observations (NASA), z-scores and p-values results of Local Moranâ€™s Bivariate statistic.
